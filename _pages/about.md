I am a PhD student in Maja Mataric's [Interaction Lab](http://robotics.usc.edu/interaction/) at the University of Southern California. In the Interaction Lab, I explore how Socially Assistive Robots can be used in interventions to aid cognitive and physical development for children. My research focuses on computational models of Human-Robot Interaction, as well as on interaction design.
