I am a PhD student in Maja Mataric's [Interaction Lab](http://robotics.usc.edu/interaction/) at the University of Southern California. In the Interaction Lab, I explore how Socially Assistive Robots can be used in interventions to aid cognitive and physical development for children. My research focuses on computational models of Human-Robot Interaction, as well as on interaction design.   

Current Work
======
I am funded on the NSF [Expeditions in Computing](http://robotics.usc.edu/interaction/sponsors/desc.php?name=expeditions) Grant for Socially Assistive Robotics for Children. For this grant I support the deployement of Kiwi the Robot to the homes of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder.  

I have also begun work on exploring the ability of a robot to facilitate trust between strangers. More details on this work will be forthcoming soon.

Personal Info
======
I graduated from Gonzaga University with a degree in Electrical Engineering and from the University of Bristol with a Masters in Research in Robotics and Autonomous Systems.
